# TJ Hates Leetcode

I actually hate doing Leetcode problems while interviewing. The only thing they learn about you is if you practiced your Leetcode recently.

I'm not saying that Leetcode is bad, but I think it's a bad way to interview someone. I think it's a good way to learn a new language or to practice your problem solving skills, but it's not a good way to interview someone.

## Reference, Don't Copy

I'm not pushing this to GitHub so you guys can copy my (or found) solutions. Refer to these if you feel stuck, or if you want to tell me I did something wrong. :P
